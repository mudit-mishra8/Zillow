This project is an end-to-end analysis of housing data scraped from Zillow. The project is divided into three parts: web scraping, data processing and model building, and statistical analysis.

## Part 1: Data Scraping

In this phase, housing data is scraped from Zillow using BeautifulSoup and Python. This includes details such as Zestimate, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, and other relevant information for each listing.

## Part 2: Data Cleaning, Transformation, Feature Engineering, and Model Building

In this section, the scraped data is cleaned, transformed, and prepared for model building. This includes handling missing values, vectorization, and feature engineering. A Linear Regression model is built to predict the Zestimate of a property. The model achieved an accuracy of approximately 92%.

## Part 3: Statistical Analysis

Statistical analysis is performed to answer questions such as how the Zestimate changes with an increase in the number of bedrooms or other features. This provides insights into what factors are most influential in determining the Zestimate.
